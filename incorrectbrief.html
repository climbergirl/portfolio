      <p>Customer centric design and user experience design are the new buzz words that everyone loves using to describe their project objectives. People love bringing designers on board to give the air that they are focusing on the customer and adopting design techniques; and most genuinely are trying. However, despite all this popularity most people don&rsquo;t understand what design thinking is or how they can steer their project in the right direction. The key difficulty with this comes through in the brief. The brief can be the difference between producing the desired end result or ending up down a rabbit hole.</p>
      <p>There are two kinds of briefs that could potentially lead to a project heading down the wrong path. First is an open ended brief, such as fix this or improve it, and second is a closed brief, such as change this image to this. Neither of these briefs will set a project up for success.</p>
      <p>Providing an open ended brief has a lot more potential for ending well than a closed brief as the designer has a lot of room to move in their design. That being said it may lead to disappointment when the output of the work is not what was expected. An open brief often comes from the misconception that the designer is understanding the project in the same way as the project initiator, however, often the designer will have a different experience or view of the solution. The best way to avoid falling into this trap is to make sure the following questions have been answered at the beginning of the project: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What</strong> &#45 What is the goal of the project? What problem is being fixed? What medium is the project being delivered on?</li>
        <li><strong>When</strong> &#45 When does the project need to be delivered?</li>
        <li><strong>Who</strong> &#45 Who is the target audience? Who is asking for the project to be done? Who are the stakeholders?</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong> &#45 Why is this project being commissioned? Why do customers see the problem as being a problem?</li>
        <li><strong>How</strong> &#45 How is the project going to be implemented?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although all of these questions should be answered prior to the project remember to keep an open mind as through research the answers may change. If the project has the ability to take these on board it could be the difference between creating a good product and a great product.</p>
      <p>The second brief that will create issues for a project is a closed brief. Although the project may be exactly as described this kind of brief limits the designer from utilising the full suite of design thinking. This may end in a product that doesn&rsquo;t actually improve the customer problems. To overcome this brief make sure to work with a designer when starting a project and don&rsquo;t engage them too late.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day if a good designer is working on a project they will be able to mould the project into something that has great potential. To help them achieve this goal, however, it is important to be clear at the beginning of the project with what is desired as well as maintaining an open mind in case something changes.</p>
